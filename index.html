        <p>
            I'm currently most interested in a small corner of the nexus between technology and everyday 
            inequality. I am constructing data engineering tools and bringing them to bear 
            on an age old problem: K-12 state reporting compliance. Focusing on automating and
            data validation methods, I rely on:
            <ul>
                <li>Python (Airflow, pandas, Selenium, and Jupyter notebooks)</li>
                <li>SQL (Oracle, Postgres, Snowflake)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>I have a B.A. in Sociology and broader interests in: Tanzania (I'm from there!), education,
            health, social networks, and natural language processing (NLP). Iâ€™ve never been much of an 
            inventor, but I feel like George Washington Carver on this keyboard.

            Technology is coolest when it works to responsibly disrupt and then deconstruct hegemonies
            while offering a path to actualize the better parts of our nature. So let's go get it.
