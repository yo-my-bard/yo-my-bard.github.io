I have raised more than my fair share of blogs, most of which never made it past 3 blog posts. However, having picked up some level of technical proficiency, I've decided to have a little more fine grained control over the simplicity of my site. It'll also be much easier to write up a post going forward if I'm working/reading up something technical and want to react. I don't know, this just feels like the start of something new and wo knows, maybe I'll write more now!
