There is not much new about this blog post. I had been putting off scraping the <a href="https://www.necta.go.tz/acsee_results">A-Level data from the NECTA</a> website because the data was structured in an intimidating fashion. I decided I could no longer wait after seeing this <a href="http://www.thecitizen.co.tz/magazine/success/-Understanding-Form-Six-regional-results-puzzle/1843788-4690616-rcjhhd/index.html">relatively shocking article</a> on the results of the exam. So, employing the scraping tools I have talked about <a href="https://elimumwalimu.wordpress.com/2018/02/25/how-web-scraping-reveals-acute-data-challenges/">here</a> to a similar problem, I can now announce that the <a href="https://github.com/yo-my-bard/Scraping-NECTA/blob/master/TZ_A-Level_Results_Scraper.ipynb">scraper code is on GitHub</a>! While not every available year's data is up yet (should be coming soon, the <a href="https://github.com/yo-my-bard/Scraping-NECTA/blob/master/CompleteDatasets/necta_acsee_2018.csv">data from 2018 is now available on GitHub</a> too.<!--more-->

If you decided to read the rest of the article, I just wanted to quickly scramble some notes about my growth in the past year. Although I started this blog February 2018, I started seriously programming and formalizing my process about a year ago. It was a hot and sweaty apartment in New York and as a result, I didn't see much sunlight. With everything that I push to GitHub, I think a lot about the kid who was excited while knowing very few tricks. I still don't know that many tricks, but going from being intimidated by a project to taking a chance and prototyping to then publishing a solution is huge!

I am happy to have returned to coding in Python for a little bit as well. I love R and I think part of the allure for me right now is that it is so seamless to pull up the RStudio environment and quickly prototype. My GitHub now has a lot of Jupyter Notebooks because it's just quicker to prototype on there for me. I heard of a Python IDE called Rodeo that is similar to RStudio so I might give that a try too. So far the combination of RStudio and Jupyter fits my needs.

Finally, I'm thinking about re-branding the blog. I love education, but it's clearly not my sole interest. Ironically, this post is about education. I do want the website and my work to branch out a little bit. The title of the blog being "Elimu, Mwalimu" (trans. Education, Teacher) is also unclear/incomplete. I want to share open source information/products, but I also want to challenge myself to build data-driven enterprises.

In the coming days, I'll be occupying myself with <strong>rebranding my portfolio</strong>; keeping the <strong>open source announcements/blogging</strong> and <strong>enterprise products</strong> duality in mind.
